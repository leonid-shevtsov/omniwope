# Hugo source

For the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

- Put the files into your Hugo directory.
- Adjust `layout/page/wope.json` to match your category to post and desired taxonomy.
- Once you build the site, the file is in `public/wope.json`.
- You probably don't want it to be published, so you can either move it out of `public`, or rename to something unfindable.
